# Youtube-Search-API

-> Firstly I created a google account to access the Google API Console, request an API key, and register your application. 
-> Create a project in the Google Developers Console
-> After creating your project, make sure the YouTube Data API is one of the services that your application is registered to use:
    Go to the API Console and select the project that you just registered.
    Visit the Enabled APIs page. In the list of APIs, make sure the status is ON for the YouTube Data API v3.
-> Go to Youtube Data API and select the HTTP request "GET" method and add all the parameters to it like part, api_key, type and query to the GET method.
-> If successful, this method returns a response body to analyze the raw body.
-> Now you can use any IDE (VS Code) and Programming languages as per your need (FLASK or JS)
-> As a first step create a body for your API using HTML and CSS.
-> As a second step code for the API to run. I used JS programming language to code the Youtube Search API.
-> Add API_KEY and other essential things to your code.
-> Connect both the Front-end and Back-end and run it on the server.
-> The API runs successfully.
